A utility of Shared Calendar for Distributed groups that would help different clients connected to a single server to optimally plan the events or meetings with all other events in mind. This utility helps different clients to share calendar events, no matter where they are. The client needs an active Internet connection, and the server would update the client's calendar within 10 seconds of a successful authentication. Every time a new client sends the connection request to the server, the server would ask the client to enter his/her username, and the server would check that the client is registered or not. If registered, would authenticate the client, and if not, would deny the connection. The security and consistency issues are correctly handled.
